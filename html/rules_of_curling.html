					<h2>How do you play curling and what are the rules?</h2>
					<p>
						A key driver of curling’s appeal is its relative simplicity. Though the sport may have unfamiliar 
						terms, and thus seem complicated, it’s actually pretty easy to follow.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						A curling match <em>consist</em> of 10 <strong>ends</strong>, which are equivalent to innings in baseball. In each end, 
						the four players on both teams alternate throwing stones. The <strong>lead</strong> throws first, followed by 
						the <strong>second</strong>, then the <strong>third</strong> — or <strong>vice-skip</strong> — then finally, the <strong>skip</strong>. Each of the four players on the 
						competing teams throws two stones per end, for a total of 16 stones. The “skip” is the most important 
						player on the team. The skip not only throws the last stone in an end — which often determines 
						the scoring — but also directs the overall strategy.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						To execute a shot, a curler pushes a foot off the <strong>hack</strong>, a piece of rubber akin to a starting block. 
						The curler slides across the ice, or <strong>sheet</strong>, to the <strong>hog</strong> line, and must release the stone before it 
						touches the <strong>line</strong>. The stone then heads for the <strong>house</strong> — the area with four concentric circles on 
						the other side of the sheet that loosely resembles a dartboard. The house is the scoring area.
					</p>

					<h2>How does curling scoring work?</h2>
					<p>
						Only one team can score during a curling end. The team with the most stones closest to the curling bullseye — the button — is awarded points. 
						So if, after 16 stones are thrown, Team A has a stone right on the <strong>button</strong>, and Team B has a stone a few feet off the button, Team A scores a point. 
						If Team A had one stone on the button and a stone a few feet off the button, while Team B had a stone on the outer edge of the house, Team A scores two points. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The team that fails to score in an end gets the <strong>hammer</strong>, or the advantage of throwing the last stone, in the next end. If no stones remain in the house 
						after an end, no points are awarded: the team with the hammer in a scoreless, or blank, end retains the hammer in the subsequent end. 
						The team with the most points after 10 ends wins the match.
					</p>
				</article>

					<h2>What’s with the curling brooms?</h2>
					<p>
						After a curler throws a stone, his or her teammates will often start sweeping the ice in front the stone as it glides down the ice. Why is sweeping 
						the activity that requires the most exertion in this particular Olympic sport? Physics! The sweeping warms the ice and reduces friction, allowing 
						the stone to travel farther and straighter. Depending on the path of the stone and its intended target, a team’s skip will instruct the other curlers to 
						either start sweeping like a teen whose parents are returning home early to an illicit house party, or to lift their brooms.
